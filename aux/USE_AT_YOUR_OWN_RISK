You have been warned.

The Makefiles present in this folder have only been tested on my machine. They
don't correctly check whether variables are empty or not and whether directories
exist before calling rm and the like. Therefore you should assume that they
will wipe your hard drive. Should you--despite this warning--decide that you
absolutely want to try them, you should first read them and comprehend what
every step is trying to achieve.
